## About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, advised by Fredrik Johansson and [Devdatt Dubhashi](https://sites.google.com/view/devdattdubhashi/home). My work is generously supported by the [The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org).

Prior to this position, I studied the engineering mathematics masters programme here at Chalmers.


## Research

I am interested in topics that get at the core of generalization, in particular concering the domain adaptation setting. I am also interested in novel assumptions which are made in this setting.

## Teaching

* Design of AI systems
* Discrete optimization  
* Introduction to Data Science and AI
