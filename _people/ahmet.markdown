## About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, advised by Fredrik Johansson and [Devdatt Dubhashi](https://sites.google.com/view/devdattdubhashi/home). My work is generously supported by the [The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org).

I have received Hon. BS from the University of Toronto in Nov 2018, where I majored in physics and minored in mathematics and statistics. I obtained my master's in Statistics at Yildiz Technical University in Aug 2022. I have extensive machine learning experince from NLP and outlier detection to neural graphics.
