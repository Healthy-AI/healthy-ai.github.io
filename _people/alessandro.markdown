## About me

I am a industrial Ph.D. At AstraZeneca  and in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, funded by WASP (https://wasp-sweden.org/). Under the supervision of [Fredrik Johansson](https://www.healthyai.se/people/fredrik) and Claudia Cabrera (Epidemiology Director at AstraZeneca). My work focus on leveraging Real World Data and Machine learning to improve clinical knowledge.

I hold a Pharmacy Doctorate (PharmD) and Master’s Degree in Health Engineering both from Aix-Marseille Université.



## Research

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference and interpretable models for observational studies and clinical trials.
