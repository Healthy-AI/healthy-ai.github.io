## About me

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) (https://www.epfl.ch/de/). As part of my Master’s in AI in Medicine at [the University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/), I am currently working on my Master’s thesis at the Healthy AI Lab.

## Research

My Master’s thesis focuses on classifying white blood cells using diffusion models in a few-shot learning setting. The goal is to evaluate the usefulness of a [Time-step Few-Shot (TiF) learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02649) on a leukocyte microscopy image dataset.
