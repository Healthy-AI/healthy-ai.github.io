## About me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, funded by the [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/english.html). Under the supervision of [Fredrik Johansson](https://www.healthyai.se/people/fredrik) and [Ida Häggström](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/idah) I work with the application of machine learning within the field of medical image analysis.

My educational background consists of a B.Sc. in Software Engineering and a M.Sc. in Data Science and AI, both attended here at Chalmers.

In my spare time I enjoy climbing, running, and watching movies.

## Research

My research is focused on the intersection of machine learning and medical image analysis. I am interested in all problems that pose a practical challenge in health care and creating systems that can support clinicians in their work.
