## About me 
Lena Stempfle is a postdoctoral associated with MIT Healthy ML group led by Marzyeh Ghassemi with [The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org) International Postdoctoral Scholarship. She completed her PhD in Computer Science at Chalmers University of Technology, advised by Fredrik Johansson and [Devdatt Dubhashi](https://sites.google.com/view/devdattdubhashi/home).

## Research 

I am interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, such as predictions with missing values, time series, and causality, to develop interpretable and accurate models to assist with clinical decision-making. 

## Teaching during PhD

*Causality and Causal Inference  
*Design for AI systems  
*Introduction to Data Science  
*Research Methods for Data Science
