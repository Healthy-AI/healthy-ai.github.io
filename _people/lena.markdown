## About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, advised by Fredrik Johansson and [Devdatt Dubhashi](https://sites.google.com/view/devdattdubhashi/home). My work is generously supported by the [The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org). 



## Research 

I am interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, such as predictions with missing values, time series and causality, 
with the goal of developing interpretable and accurate models to assist with clinical decision-making.
