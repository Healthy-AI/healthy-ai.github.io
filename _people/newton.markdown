## About me

![Newton](/assets/people/newton.jpeg){:class="people-profile-image"}

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, within the Healthy AI Lab advised by [Fredrik D. Johansson](https://www.healthyai.se/people/fredrik) working in machine learning for improved sequential decision making in healthcare, with historical data. My research is funded by the [The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org).

Prior to joining Chalmers, I did a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University, Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/) in Kigali, Rwanda. During my masters, I did [a research internship](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_31) at [IBM Research's Science for Social Good](https://research.ibm.com/science-for-social-good/) where my main advisor was Dr. Kush R. Varshney. I did my bachelors at [Dedan Kimathi University of Technology](https://www.dkut.ac.ke/) in Nyeri, Kenya, where I graduated with double degrees in BSc. Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and BSc. Telecommunication and Information Engineering. For my bachelor thesis, I did research with [Dr. Ciira Maina](https://sites.google.com/site/cwamainadekut/).

I enjoy hiking, climbing and dancing in my free time.

## Research

My research encompasses causal inference and sequential decision making methods in multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning.
