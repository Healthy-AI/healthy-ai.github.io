## About me
I am a posdoc under the [Wallenberg-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/calls/wallenberg-foundation-postdoctoral-fellowships-nanyang-technological-university-singapore) program. I am with the Healthy AI Lab advised by [Fredrik D. Johansson](https://www.healthyai.se/people/fredrik) at Chalmers University of Technology.
Prior to this, I obtained both my bachelor degree (Electrical & Electronic Engineering, 2017) and PhD (Computer Science, 2023, supervised by Hanwang Zhang) in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In my free time, I love board games, photography and cycling.

## Research
Broadly speaking, my research interest is generalization in machine learning, and my past research is primarily in computer vision and multimodal learning. More info can be found in my homepage: https://yue-zhongqi.github.io.
