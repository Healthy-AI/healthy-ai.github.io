## About me
After completing my B.Sc. in Information and Computing Science, I enrolled in the Data Science and AI Master’s program at Chalmers University of Technology in 2022. In my second year of the master’s program, I joined the Healthy AI Lab, where I am working on a project and my master's thesis under the supervision of Fredrik Johansson.

I enjoy music, art, movies, and jazz dancing.

## Research
I am interested in the combination of machine learning and healthcare, including interpretable machine learning, off-policy evaluation, and causal inference.
