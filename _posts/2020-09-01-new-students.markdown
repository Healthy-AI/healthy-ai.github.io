As of September 2020, the division of Data Science & AI have four brand new PhD students with Fredrik Johansson as main advisor. This marks the start of the Healthy AI lab at Chalmers University of Technology. Adam Breitholtz, Newton Mwai, Lena Stempfle and Anton Matsson begin their doctoral studies, funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software programme. We conduct research into machine learning for decision making and causal inference with applications in healthcare.
