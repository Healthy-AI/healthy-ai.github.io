  As of September 2020, the division of Data Science & AI have four brand new PhD students with Fredrik Johansson as main advisor. This marks the start of the Healthy AI lab at Chalmers University of Technology. Adam Breitholtz, Newton Mwai, Lena Stempfle and Anton Matsson begin their doctoral studies, funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software programme.

Finding an effective medical treatment often requires a search by trial and error. Making this search more efficient by minimizing the number of unnecessary trials could lower both costs and patient suffering. We formalize this problem as learning a policy for finding a near-optimal treatment in a minimum number of trials using a causal inference framework. We give a model-based dynamic programming algorithm which learns from observational data while being robust to unmeasured confounding. To reduce time complexity, we suggest a greedy algorithm which bounds the near-optimality constraint. The methods are evaluated on synthetic and real-world healthcare data and compared to model-free reinforcement learning. We find that our methods compare favorably to the model-free baseline while offering a more transparent trade-off between search time and treatment efficacy.
