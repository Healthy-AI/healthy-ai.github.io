Chalmers AI Research Centre and Sahlgrenska University Hospital are organizing a workshop on the theme "The Learning Hospital". The workshop is aimed at researchers and clinicians who are interested in how analysts and healthcare providers can best work together to improve machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence for decision-making in health. The event will host international and local speakers with experience in applying and/or deploying machine learning in healthcare and will feature interactive workshop sessions with the goal to find out how Chalmers and Sahlgrenska can grow together in this field. We ask questions like: How should ML systems be built, deployed, and evaluated to guarantee continuous high-quality care? How should clinical data be collected, stored, and used to support causal inferences about the effects of clinical policy? What needs to change about ML to work effectively in a hospital setting?
